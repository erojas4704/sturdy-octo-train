# Calculating Range of a Projectile

This is a node-based command line tool for calculating the range of a projectile. This was done as an experiment for Javascript Gym time.

## Usage

Command line:
```
node app.js -v velocity -a angle -h height
```

Where v is velocity, a is equal to angle, in degrees, and h is equal to height.

## Testing

Unit tests with jest.

```
jest
```
